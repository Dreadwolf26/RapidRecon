# RapidRecon

**RapidRecon** is a powerful, Nmap-based reconnaissance tool designed for cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers. It provides several options for scanning targets, discovering vulnerabilities, and gathering useful recon information.

## Features

- Quick scan of top 100 ports
- Comprehensive scan with SYN, service detection, and OS detection
- Vulnerability scanning using Nmap's scripting engine
- OS detection and aggressive recon mode
- DNS enumeration and traceroute
- Custom port range scanning
- Firewall evasion techniques (fragmentation, random hosts, bad checksum)
- Export scan results to a text file for further analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Nmap
- Python modules:
  - `nmap` (Python Nmap bindings)

## Installation

### System Requirements

1. **Install Nmap**: You must have Nmap installed on your system. You can install it using the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nmap
   ```

2. **Install Python3-Nmap**: To run **RapidRecon**, you need the Python Nmap bindings. You can install them using `apt`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-nmap
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dreadwolf26/RapidRecon.git
   cd RapidRecon
   ```

4. **Run RapidRecon**: To run the tool, use the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 rapidrecon.py
   ```

> **Note**: Certain scans require root privileges, such as SYN scans, OS detection, and aggressive recon mode. Make sure to run the script with `sudo` if you encounter permission errors.

## Usage

Once you run the script, you'll be prompted to enter a domain name or IP address for scanning. After that, select one of the available scan options.

### Scan Options

1. **Quick Scan**: Scans the top 100 most common ports on the target.
2. **Comprehensive Scan**: Performs a SYN scan, detects services, and attempts OS detection.
3. **Ping Scan**: Performs host discovery to check if the target is alive.
4. **Vulnerability Scan**: Checks the target for known vulnerabilities using Nmap's `vuln` scripts.
5. **OS Detection**: Detects the target's operating system.
6. **Aggressive Recon**: Combines OS detection, service detection, and traceroute.
7. **Traceroute**: Maps the route from your machine to the target.
8. **Custom Port Range Scan**: Allows scanning of a custom range of ports.
9. **DNS Enumeration**: Enumerates subdomains and DNS records of the target.
10. **Firewall Evasion Techniques**: Uses techniques like fragmentation, bad checksum, or random host order to evade firewalls.

### Example Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 rapidrecon.py
   ```

2. Enter the target domain name or IP address:
   ```
   Please enter a domain name or IP address: example.com
   ```

3. Select a scan option:
   ```
   Scan Options:
   1. Quick Scan (Top 100 Ports)
   2. Comprehensive Scan (SYN, Service Detection, OS Detection)
   3. Ping Scan (Host Discovery)
   4. Vulnerability Scan
   5. OS Detection
   6. Aggressive Recon (OS, Service Detection, Traceroute)
   7. Traceroute
   8. Custom Port Range Scan
   9. DNS Enumeration
   10. Firewall Evasion Techniques
   11. Exit
   ```

4. **Save Results**: After each scan, you will be prompted to save the scan results to a text file. Enter a filename to save the results, or skip if you donâ€™t want to save them.

## Requirements and Root Privileges

Some scans require elevated privileges (root access) to perform actions like SYN scanning or OS detection. Make sure to run **RapidRecon** with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo python3 rapidrecon.py
```

## Known Issues

- The Python Nmap package must be installed globally for `sudo` to recognize it, or you can use the virtual environment's Python interpreter when running with `sudo`.
- Some firewall evasion techniques may require additional privileges depending on the target and network environment.
